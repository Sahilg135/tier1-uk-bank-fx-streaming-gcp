## Reuse guidance (practical)

- **Diagrams (Mermaid)**
  - ✅ You can copy the diagram code and adapt it.
  - 📝 Keep a small attribution line somewhere in your doc (example below).
  - 🔒 Do not add real client names/data when publishing your fork.

- **Text & structure**
  - ✅ You can reuse the section structure (Context, Architecture, Sequence,
    Security Boundary, Data Models, SLOs/Observability, CI/CD, License).
  - 📝 Adjust KPIs/SLOs to your system; don’t claim the numbers here as facts
    about any real client.

- **Examples & snippets**
  - ✅ Use and modify freely under MIT.
  - ❗ Verify that any referenced GitHub Actions or badges also allow your use.
