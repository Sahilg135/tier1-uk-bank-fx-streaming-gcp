> Note: Sanitized case study from my Cognizant engagement; patterns only—no client code/data.

> **TL;DR**: Real‑time FX event ingestion, validation, enrichment, and analytics on **GCP** using **Pub/Sub → Dataflow (Apache Beam) → BigQuery**, orchestrated by **Composer**, with **VPC‑SC/CMEK** governance. Targets **p95 < 90s** E2E latency at ~**2–2.5M events/day**. This repo shares **patterns only** — no client code or data.

## Why this architecture
Risk & compliance require **T+0 visibility** into FX trades. The platform captures trades/quotes, validates & enriches them, and serves curated BigQuery marts and near‑real‑time dashboards with auditable lineage and low ops overhead.

### Key Outcomes
- **Manual interventions ↓ ~95%** via strong DQ + DLQ flows
- **Reporting 2× faster**, intra‑day risk views
- **p95 E2E latency < 90s** at peak **350–500 msg/s**
- **Infra cost ↓ ~35–40%** with BQ partition/cluster + autoscaling

## Data Model (curated highlights)
- `fx_trade_fact(trade_id PK, version, side, symbol, qty, px, notional_usd, trader, desk, status, event_ts)`
- `fx_limit_breach(desk, symbol, window_notional_usd, limit_usd, breach_flag, breach_ts)`
- `fx_risk_snapshot_1min(ts, desk, symbol, notional_usd, pnl)`

Partition by `trade_date`; cluster by `desk, symbol`. Materialize common aggregates for BI.

---

## SLOs & Observability
- **Delivery success ≥ 99.5%**, **p95 E2E < 90s**, **DLQ rate < 0.5%**
- Cloud Monitoring dashboards on latency, backlog, watermark skew; logs‑based alerts to on‑call.

---

## Author’s responsibilities (what I owned)
- Streaming design on **GCP**; Beam pipelines for **dedup**, **late-data**, **enrichment**, **DLQ**.
- **BigQuery modeling** (raw → stage → mart), partition/cluster strategy, and cost tuning.
- **Security/governance:** **VPC‑SC**, **CMEK**, least‑privilege SA IAM; PII masking UDFs.
- **Ops:** Composer DAGs for replay/compaction/exports; SLOs, alerts, and runbooks.

## Reuse this pattern
- Works for **trades, orders, payments, logs, IoT** — any high‑volume event stream with compliance needs.
- Swap **Pub/Sub/Dataflow** with **Kafka/Spark** if required; principles stay the same (contracts, DQ, governance, SLOs).
